    Mobius Object
    -------------

	I love looking at the Mobius-related renderings that artistically and scientifically inclined people
	put up on places like DeviantArt, etc. There are so many interesting variations and rendering styles 
	out there. There's also a few interesting examples on this site. Anyway, here's yet another one.

	Aesthetically speaking, I started with a clean look that emphasized the Mobius object, then lost focus 
    and got carried away with the surroundings, which for some reason, led to things resembling a grungey, 
	brooding early-2000s demo scene. :) I saved the cleaner version, so I might put that up later.

	Topology was a long time ago for me, so I'm not sure what the object is technically called, but it's 
	easy to see that it's based on the Mobius strip. In descriptive terms, I guess it's a toroidal shape... 
	twisted in the poloidal direction about the toroidal axis? Either way, these things are not much more 
    difficult to code than a torus.

	As for the Mobius object construction, it's pretty straight forward for anyone comfortable with the 
	concepts behind a toroidal distance field. As always, it was helpful to have examples on this site to 
	refer to. One of Dr2's versions helped me correct an annoying quantization error I was making. I'm 
	human, and therefore prone to errors. Thankfully, Dr2 is not. :D
